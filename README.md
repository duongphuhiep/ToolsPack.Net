# The .NETStandard implementation is available [HERE](https://github.com/duongphuhiep/ToolsPack.NetCore)

My collection of many small useful code-snippet .net, wrapping in reusable library with unobtrusive dependencies.

Some of the most-used library are published on nuget.

* [See wiki document for brief introduction code](https://github.com/duongphuhiep/ToolsPack.Net/wiki)
* [This sample](https://github.com/duongphuhiep/ToolsPack.Net/wiki/ToolsPack.Net-Usage-Sample) demonstrates How usefull 
[`ToolsPack.Net`](https://github.com/duongphuhiep/ToolsPack.Net/wiki) is.

Navigate to the code and unit test samples for more information.

## Remark

* I won't update much on this repository because the code is very stable. Nearly Zero-maintenance is needed.

* Maybe the `ToolsPack.Log4Net` is the only one need to upgrade beacause it depends on the [`log4net` package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/log4net/) which is occasionally upgraded. Evens if `ToolsPack.Log4Net` stuck with the old log4net version here, we can of course use it with the newer [`log4net` package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/log4net/)
